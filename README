This script will name a folder full of random MP3 files based on their
ID3 tags. It names them like:

Artist - Album - Track - Title.mp3

If a piece of info is not in the tag, it won't use it. If Title is 
missing, the original filename will be used instead.

Also, this is my first-ever Python script. Expect more features soon.


TODO: Command-line features:
 * mp3name.exe [c:\dir\to\scan] [-i] [-c] [-f]
 * Dir to scan = defaults to current dir
 * -i = Invert artist (e.g. 'The Beatles' = 'Beatles, The'
 * -c = Capitalize Words (default uses tag data)
 * -f = Sort into artist/album folders
